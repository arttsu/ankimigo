* Tracer bullet session 7

** What was accomplished

*** Completed Stage 6: AnkiConnect Card Pushing
- âœ… push-cards-to-anki function to send cards via AnkiConnect addNotes API
- âœ… Batch processing with single HTTP request for multiple cards
- âœ… "Push to Anki" button fully functional with real card data
- âœ… Card validation - only valid cards sent to Anki
- âœ… Duplicate handling - graceful response when cards already exist
- âœ… Success/failure feedback with detailed status messages
- âœ… Cards preserved with Anki note IDs instead of clearing
- âœ… Button disable logic when no deck selected or no valid cards
- âœ… Error handling for connection failures and API errors

*** Key improvements implemented
- *Card preservation*: Cards remain visible with green Anki note IDs after push
- *Accurate feedback*: Fixed card count bug in status messages
- *Code organization*: Decomposed large function into smaller, focused functions
- *Error resilience*: Comprehensive validation and error handling
- *UI responsiveness*: Button disabled when prerequisites not met
- *User experience*: Clear indication of pushed cards vs pending cards

*** Development approach used
- *Incremental implementation with explicit CHECKPOINTs*: Each step verified before proceeding
- *Small function decomposition*: Large functions broken into focused components
- *Test-driven fixes*: Identified and fixed bugs through actual usage
- *Progressive enhancement*: Core function -> handler -> UI integration -> polish

** Current code structure

*** src/ankimigo/main.clj
- *State shape* (unchanged from session 6):
  ```clojure
  {:prompt-inputs {:concept ""}
   :status-message "Ready."
   :llm-response ""
   :parsed-cards []          ; Now cards can have :anki-note-id field
   :available-decks []
   :selected-deck nil
   :paste-dialog {:visible false :text ""}}
  ```
- *New AnkiConnect functions*:
  - cards-to-anki-notes: Convert cards to AnkiConnect note format
  - send-cards-to-anki: Make HTTP POST request with addNotes action
  - process-anki-response: Parse response and create detailed results
  - push-cards-to-anki: Main orchestrator function with error handling
- *Updated UI components*:
  - render-valid-card: Now shows green Anki note ID when present (with nil filtering)
  - anki-controls: Push button disabled when no deck/valid cards
- *Updated event handlers*:
  - ::push-to-anki: Complete implementation with validation, push, and state updates

*** Key technical patterns established
- *Function decomposition*: Large functions split into single-responsibility components
- *Card state management*: Cards updated with IDs rather than cleared
- *Batch API usage*: Single addNotes request for efficiency
- *Response parsing*: Proper handling of AnkiConnect result array (IDs and nulls)
- *UI error prevention*: filterv some? to remove nil components
- *Validation flow*: deck selected + valid cards present before push enabled

** Test procedure for current state

1. Run application: =clojure -M -m ankimigo.main=
2. Verify three-column layout appears
3. **Test full Stage 6 workflow**:
   - Enter concept (e.g., "perro")
   - Copy prompt, paste to LLM, get response
   - Paste JSON response with cards
   - Verify cards parsed and displayed
   - Fetch decks and select target deck
   - Verify Push button enables when deck+cards ready
   - Click "Push to Anki" button
   - Verify status shows accurate count (e.g., "Pushed 2 cards")
   - Verify cards now show green "Anki ID: 1234567890" labels
   - Verify cards remain visible (not cleared)
4. **Test duplicate handling**:
   - Generate same cards again
   - Push to same deck
   - Verify status shows "Pushed 0 cards, 2 duplicates"
5. **Test validation**:
   - Try pushing with no deck selected -> "Please select a deck first"
   - Try pushing with no cards -> "No cards to push"
   - Try pushing with only invalid cards -> "No valid cards to push"
6. **Test button disable logic**:
   - Verify Push button disabled when no deck selected
   - Verify Push button disabled when no cards
   - Verify Push button disabled when only invalid cards
   - Verify Push button enabled when deck + valid cards present
7. **Test error handling**:
   - Stop Anki, try to push -> "Failed to push cards to Anki"
   - Start Anki, retry -> should work

** Technical fixes applied

*** Card count bug fix
- *Issue*: Status showed "Pushed 0 cards" despite successful pushes
- *Root cause*: Inconsistent use of string vs keyword keys with json/keyword-keys-object-mapper
- *Fix*: Changed `(get body "result")` to `(:result body)` and `(get body "error")` to `(:error body)`
- *Files modified*: src/ankimigo/main.clj lines 104-108

*** Card preservation instead of clearing
- *Issue*: Cards disappeared after successful push, losing context for user
- *Enhancement*: Cards remain visible with Anki note IDs for future reference/editing
- *Implementation*: Added :cards-with-ids to result, updated handler to merge with invalid cards
- *UI enhancement*: render-valid-card shows green Anki ID label when present
- *Files modified*: src/ankimigo/main.clj lines 116-118, 402-409, 224-227

*** Function decomposition
- *Issue*: push-cards-to-anki was too large (40+ lines) and hard to test/maintain
- *Solution*: Split into 4 focused functions:
  - `cards-to-anki-notes` (9 lines): Format conversion only
  - `send-cards-to-anki` (8 lines): HTTP request only
  - `process-anki-response` (16 lines): Response parsing only
  - `push-cards-to-anki` (10 lines): Main orchestrator
- *Benefits*: Easier testing, clearer responsibilities, better maintainability
- *Files modified*: src/ankimigo/main.clj lines 76-131

*** UI nil component fix
- *Issue*: `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No implementation of method: :create`
- *Root cause*: `when` clause returning nil when no :anki-note-id present
- *Fix*: Added `(filterv some? [...])` to remove nil components
- *Files modified*: src/ankimigo/main.clj lines 214, 227

*** ðŸŽ‰ TRACER BULLET COMPLETE
The full end-to-end workflow is now functional:
**Concept â†’ Prompt â†’ LLM Response â†’ Parsed Cards â†’ Deck Selection â†’ Push to Anki**

All core requirements from the tracer bullet specification have been implemented:
- User can input a concept
- System generates appropriate prompt
- User gets LLM response and pastes it back
- Cards are parsed and validated
- User selects target Anki deck
- Cards are pushed to Anki with full feedback
- Cards remain visible with Anki IDs for tracking

## Next steps (beyond tracer bullet scope)

*** Potential enhancements for future sessions
- *Card editing*: Allow editing cards before/after push
- *Deck management*: Create new decks from within app
- *Model selection*: Support different Anki note models beyond "Basic"
- *Tag management*: Allow custom tags beyond "ankimigo"
- *Batch operations*: Support multiple concepts in single session
- *Configuration*: Persist user preferences (last deck, model, etc.)
- *Export/Import*: Save/load card sets as JSON files
- *Undo functionality*: Reverse pushed cards if needed

*** Technical debt to address
- Add clojure.spec for state validation
- Implement comprehensive test suite
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Consider timeout for auto-clearing status messages
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Improve error messages with actionable suggestions

** Session 8 prep (if continuing beyond tracer bullet)

*** Quick start
```bash
cd /home/art/repos/ankimigo
clojure -M -m ankimigo.main
```

*** Current working features to preserve
- Complete end-to-end workflow from concept to Anki
- JSON parsing with validation and error display
- Invalid cards shown with pink background
- Modal dialog for pasting LLM responses
- Clipboard copying with validation
- Three-column responsive layout
- Deck fetching and selection from AnkiConnect
- Card pushing with ID tracking and preservation
- Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- Button state management and validation
- Status messaging for user feedback

*** Code quality established
- Small, focused functions with single responsibilities
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Comprehensive input validation
- Clean separation of concerns (UI, state, API)
- Descriptive function and variable names
- Proper documentation strings

*** Testing approach validated
- Incremental development with explicit checkpoints
- Real integration testing with actual AnkiConnect
- Edge case validation (duplicates, failures, missing data)
- User workflow testing end-to-end
- Error condition testing (network failures, invalid input)

The tracer bullet implementation is now complete and serves as a solid foundation for any future enhancements to the AnkiMigo application.
